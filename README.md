I'm putting the notes here. 

To be aware of:

1. Dozens of citations need to be added. I will do a pass where I add references to many, many things.
2. Chapter 3 is extremely rough right now. It was written before some very important changes were made to Chapter 1, so do not pay it *too much* mind.
